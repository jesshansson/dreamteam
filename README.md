## The Dream Team

In this project, I created a React web app that allows users to explore superheroes and villains using an API, and build their own "Dream Team" of heroes.

#### Features:

- Search for superheroes and villains by name or filter by attributes
- Add superheroes to your personal Dream Team.
- Edit information about the superheroes you add to your team.
- Remove or update superheroes from your team.
- Team statistics page.

#### Tech:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Context for global state management
- localStorage
- React router loader
- API: [Superhero API](https://github.com/akabab/superhero-api)
- Tailwind CSS components (but mostly vanilla CSS)
- Chart.js
